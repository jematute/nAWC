<table style="width:100%;border:none;border-spacing:0px"><tr style="vertical-align:top"><td style="text-align:left;padding:5px">
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">When a document has a status of IN, there is only one current copy of the document. Viewing or copying that document clearly refers to this one current copy. However, when a document status is Out or Hold/Review, there is more than one copy: the one in the library and the one that is work-in-progress (WIP). In addition, as you check documents in and out of Hold/Review, Adept saves intermediate versions. When a user wants to access a document with a status of Out or Hold/Review, Adept and/or the user needs to specify which one of these copies is the one that will be displayed.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">These two copies, the one that is In and the one or more that are Out or WIP, may differ. In addition, their data cards might differ and the documents they reference might differ as well. Because of the potential difference between the In version and the versions that are WIP, it is good to keep in mind all the ways these two documents might differ. </span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">Of course the most important difference might be in the document itself. When viewing assemblies or opening them in supported CAD software, you need to know if the children are the ones that are In or the ones that are WIP. You need to know if the relationship tree in the Document Dashboard is the one that the library copy knows about or the one that the WIP knows about. The Data Card may reflect data from the library or from the WIP. The column fields in Adept’s windows could reflect either the ones in the library or the ones in progress.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-style: italic;">Note: The status of documents reflected in the Relationship Tree is an indication of the document's status which may or may not correspond to the document being resolved when opening the parent document.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">It's important to know the rules that control which of these two sets of data you see. In order to know whether you are seeing the data from the version In the library or from the version Out or on Hold/Review, take a look at the status bar of the Adept window to see whether your Information Source is WIP or Library. </span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">If the Status Bar indicates the &quot;Information Source&quot; is set to Library, then the documents in the Search Results or FileGuide will refer to the version of the document that is In, even when there is a WIP copy. Documents in the Document Dashboard's WIP tab will ignore Information Source and Adept will display whatever version you clicked on.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-style: italic;">Note: In this case those documents which have a WIP copy will appear in green text.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">If the Status Bar indicates the Information Source is set to WIP then the documents will refer to the version Out or Hold/Review, if available. If they are Out or on Hold/Review to another user, Adept will inform you that they are not available.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-style: italic;">Note: The WIP Versions tab of the Document Dashboard lists versions of the document, including the IN version if one exists. When you select one of the rows in this WIP Versions tab, Adept will display the version you selected regardless of the setting for Information Source. For example if Information Source is set to WIP and you select the IN version from the WIP Versions tab, you will display or print the IN version of the document. </span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">There are several possible areas where the documents could differ, depending on if it is the In copy or the WIP. Of course the documents themselves could differ. In addition, other pieces of data could differ:</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">When viewing assemblies or opening them in supported CAD software, you need to know if the children are the ones that are In or the ones that are WIP. You need to know if the relationship tree in the Document Dashboard is the one that the library copy knows about or the one that the work-in-progress knows about. The Data Card may reflect data from the library or from the WIP. The column fields in Adept’s windows could reflect either the ones in the library or the ones in progress</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Data Card</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">When viewing a data card, the default data you see depends on the Information Source. So if the Information Source is set to view the copy in the library, that copy is the one that is displayed by default in the Data Card. To toggle back and forth between Data Card values the in the library copy and the WIP copy, check/uncheck the View Library Copy check box at the top of the data card.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Column Fields and the Document Dashboard Tree</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">When viewing information in any Adept window, you can determine whether the information in the columns comes from the copy in the library or WIP by selecting the appropriate choice from the Information Source. Set the Information Source by clicking Information Source on the Adept status bar. Adept provides color-coded feedback to help users see at a glance whether they are looking at the document that is WIP, or is this the document that is in the library.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-style: italic;">Note: If you have Information Source set to WIP, you can see relationships for documents with a status of Hold/Review that you may or may not have the rights to view.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Information Source and Incremental Version Number</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">When Adept displays work-in-progress the Adept Version number includes a minor release number. For example a work-in-progress document that has been checked out from Hold several times might have the Adept Version number of 2.4, meaning it is Adept Major Version 2 and Minor Version 4.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">Documents that are in the library always have an Adept Minor Version of 0, for example, the Adept Version of a library document might be 2.0.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">View/Resolve to WIP</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">The user's ability to see a document on Hold is partly determined by whether or not the user has the library access right to View/Resolve to WIP. This right affects which copy of a document is accessed when its status is Hold.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-style: italic;">Note: Documents in a workflow are on Hold/Review status. Therefore to give users in a workflow the right to see the documents in that workflow, you must grant all such reviewers the right to View/Resolve to WIP.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">When a document is WIP, all users should always see the In versions of children and not the Hold/Review version. The exceptions are if the user…</span></p>

<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">The Adept administrator can extend the number of users who can see documents on Hold by granting the Library Access Right to View/Resolve to WIP. This extends access to these documents to any user who has the appropriate rights to this library.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-style: italic;">Note: If you don’t want users to see what's on Hold, don't grant this right. Make sure the users are not workflow managers or admins. Don't forget that for any document on Hold, if the user is the Last Owner the Hold/Review copy can be viewed.</span></p>

<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Viewing/CAD Opening when parent is OUT to you and children are OUT to you</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">When opening CAD, children will always resolve to the WIP (on hold or out to you) if the parent and children reside in the same Adept Work Area. Adept will not resolve children across different Work Areas.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Behavior of children checked out to a Shared Work Area</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">Documents checked out to a shared work area (SWA) are available to all members of that SWA. All parents and children with a status of Out in the SWA will be resolved within that SWA. If a user of a SWA checks out a child to their own private work area, then only that user will see the relationship between the parent and the child in the work area. All other users of the SWA who view or open the parent will see the child in the library, although the Document Dashboard will note the child as Out.</span></p>

<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Viewing</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">When viewing documents, the viewer resolves to the copy specified by the current setting of Information Source.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Opening CAD</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">If you are the last owner of the document(s) on Hold, if you are a workflow manager for that library, or if you are an administrator, when opening CAD, children will always resolve on Hold/Review</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">If you are not the last owner of the document(s) on Hold, if you are not a workflow manager for that library, or you are not an administrator and you don't have the Library Access Right to View/Resolve to WIP, when opening CAD, children will always resolve to In.</span></p>

<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Viewing/CAD Opening when parent is OUT to someone else</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">If a parent is Out to someone else, you can only view the parent and children that are In the library.</span></p>
