<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">The Results Area will always show the results from the selection in the left side pane. As you browse or search using the panes, results will be shown in the Results Area.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">Use the Results Area to review the documents you have searched or browsed for. The title bar of the results area will provide information regarding how the results showing were calculated. For example, if the results are from a search, the search criteria will be shown in the title bar.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Column information in the Results Area</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">The default columns are filename, status, library, and owner. The user may select the three lines icon on the far right side of the results area title bar (hamburger) to access the grid settings used for the results area. In this dialog, the user may add or remove columns from the results area display by dragging and dropping the columns from one side of the dialog to the other. Columns listed on the left side include all customer Adept data fields as well as system fields. Fields are listed alphabetically with custom fields in black and system fields having a blue hue. Columns cannot be repeated and can be added only once. Added columns will be retained until removed by the user. </span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">A second tab provides access to defined Column Sets that are available for the user. Column Sets can only be created and shared from within the Adept Desktop Client but shared Column Sets are visible in the Adept Web Client applications.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">Columns can be reordered by dragging and dropping within the right column of the dialog. </span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">Next to the Grid Setting icon is a drop down used to specify the number of results to be displayed in the results area for a single page. Should the results of any search or selection exceed this number, then to view those results the user must move to the next page. In general, the larger the page size, the longer Adept will take to calculate and display results. Available page size selections are fixed and cannot be changed. Page is accomplished by using the paging selections in the status bar at the bottom of the results area. There are icon selections to move to the next/previous page, the first/last page, or you can type in the specific page wanted.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">Also on the status bar, on the left side, is an Export button. Selecting this button opens a context menu with selections that control how the results area is to be exported. Selections include export to CSV or to Excel formats, and exporting only the visible results (the current page) or all results (all pages). Selections are allow to include or not include one or more of the columns currently being displayed in the results area.</span></p>
