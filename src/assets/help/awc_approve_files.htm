<table style="width:100%;border:none;border-spacing:0px"><tr style="vertical-align:top"><td style="text-align:left;padding:5px">
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">When a document is checked in to a checked library, the document is moved to the holding area and is automatically in a workflow, which means it is on a workflow step, available for review. The document will automatically appear in the Inbox of the reviewers.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Who may issue an Approve</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">You can issue the Approve command if you have been designated as a reviewer at the step in the workflow where the document resides. If the document is in a System Default Workflow, the reviewers consist of workflow managers in that library.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">All reviewers must have at least the right to view the document. In addition,they must have other Library Access Rights that control whether they can check out the document, open an application on the document in the Holding Area, or assign the document to another user for further work.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple Approvals</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">If the step requires more than one approval, then the document stays on this step of the workflow until all required approvals have been received. When the document receives sufficient approvals, it is moved to the next step. If it is at the last step of the workflow, approval moves it back into the library. If you approve the document and the document stays in the current step, it will be removed from your Inbox. You are no longer considered a reviewer for this document and can no longer issue an approve.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Add a Comment</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">When you approve a document, you are given the option to add a comment. This comment can then be viewed in the Document Dashboard's Workflow tab as well as in the Audit Trail to give an overview of the progress of the document at each step.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Assign While Approving</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">When you approve a document, the approve dialog gives you the opportunity to assign the document. The Assign list includes all Adept Administrators and then varies depending on the configuration of the workflow step.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">If the workflow step option &quot;Only allow Assignment to other reviewers&quot; is checked, the names that appear on the Assign list are the reviewers of the step to where the document is being approved who also have View/Resolve to WIP rights to the library. If the workflow step option &quot;Only allow Assignment to other reviewers&quot; is not checked, the names that appear in the Assign list will include the reviewers with View/Resolve to WIP rights to the library and any user that has View/Resolve to WIP rights to the library.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">For final approve, there is no option for assigning, so the Assign To list will not be displayed if all the documents in the dialog are on the final step. </span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">To facilitate the setting of an Assign To, you can select any documents in the Approve list, by using Windows selection methods of shift-click and control-click. When you select an Assign To, all the highlighted documents will be affected.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Approving a Document on a Workflow step that requires Multiple Reviewers</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">If the workflow step requires multiple approvals, Adept will check to see if this approval will move the document to the next step. This will determine the users in the Assign To list. If further approvals will be needed in order to move the document to the next step, the Assign To list will contain the reviewers in the current step. If this approve completes the number of approvals required for the current step, then the Assign list contains the names of reviewers in the next step.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Return to the Library</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">When a reviewer approves the document at the last step in the workflow, the document returns to the library with a status of IN.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-style: italic;">Note: Anyone who is a reviewer in the final step of a workflow has the right to approve the document and return it to the library.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">When the document is moved from the last step of the workflow back into the library, the previous copy in the library is either overwritten or saved as a version. The version level of the document &quot;collapses&quot; down to the &quot;.0&quot; version. If you have selected the option to remove all intermediate minor version levels, they are deleted at this time.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">The decision to create a version can be done in three ways.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 13px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size:10pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS','Lucida Sans Unicode','Arial';color:#000000;display:inline-block;width:13px;margin-left:-13px">&#8226;</span><span class="f_bodytext">In the Approve dialog box, the workflow manager can select an option to create a version.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 13px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size:10pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS','Lucida Sans Unicode','Arial';color:#000000;display:inline-block;width:13px;margin-left:-13px">&#8226;</span><span class="f_bodytext">If the Administrator has set this library to always create a version, then a version is created automatically whenever a document is returned to the library.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 13px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-size:10pt; font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS','Lucida Sans Unicode','Arial';color:#000000;display:inline-block;width:13px;margin-left:-13px">&#8226;</span><span class="f_bodytext">The workflow manager can manually create a version by selecting Create Version command.</span></p><p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">Workflow Managers may choose to abandon all changes and delete the edited copy of the document from HOLD. After executing Delete from WIP the edited document is deleted and the copy of the document that is in the library changes to a status of IN.</span></p>
