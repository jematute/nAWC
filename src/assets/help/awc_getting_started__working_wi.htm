<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">For first time users, here's an overview of how to start working with your documents.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">What is a &quot;document&quot;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">Typically you work with files; Word files, CAD files, Excel files. When these files are in an Adept controlled area, they are then called &quot;documents&quot;. A document is a combination of a file and database information. When a file is first seen by Adept, such as when it is placed in a Work Area, Adept learns about the file, extracting information that is put into the database. The file has become an Adept document.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Your existing &quot;legacy&quot; documents should already be included in Libraries</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">By the time you start using Adept, your Administrator has already imported almost all of your files into Adept Libraries. Files that were imported into Adept typically provide Adept with additional information about the file that was imported into Adept's database. Files in Adept coupled with their additional information in Adept's database create an Adept document. Adept now &quot;knows&quot; about each document so you'll be able to use the Search Dialog to find documents fast. Results of your search appear in the Search Results window. Or use the FileGuide or one of the many other methods to browse Adept's Vault of libraries which contain documents. Once you find the documents, you can check them out. Checking out documents creates a copy in your work area. To edit a document in your work area, open an editing application (e.g. Word or SOLIDWORKS) and open the document.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">You will only be able to see libraries for which you have been granted at least View rights.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">When you need to create new or copy existing documents</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">To create new documents, select the New Document command. You must give the new document a name and select the type of document you want to create. This will copy a document into your work area. This document is a copy of a template that has been set up by the Administrator. If a template document does not yet exist for the type of document you need to create, check with your Administrator. If you want to start from an existing document, you can make a copy of an existing document by choosing the Copy command.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-style: italic;">Note: The document is copied into the selected work area. You can add a new work area using the Add Work Area command.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Documents you've been working on during the installation process</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">If you have documents that you have been working on in your own disk area, the easiest way to get them into Adept is to add a new Work Area that points to the folder where the documents are located. When you create a new work area, Adept takes a moment to &quot;learn about&quot; or synchronize the documents that were in the folder. If your documents have a status of NEW, you're all set to edit the documents as needed and check them into Adept when you're ready.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">What to do if your documents have a status of DUPLICATE</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">Documents in your work area have a status of DUPLICATE when Adept has detected at least one other document with an identical name already in Adept libraries. If your site allows duplicate document names, you can check this in with the same name but Adept never allows two documents with the same name in the same library. If your site enforces unique document names, you might rename the duplicate and check it in as a new document or you could delete the duplicate when you no longer need it.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">In certain circumstances, you may need to overwrite the document in your library by copying over it with a duplicate document from the work area. In this special circumstance, use the <a href="awc_acquire_checkout.htm" class="topiclink">Acquire Check Out</a> command to change the document's DUPLICATE status to OUT. Then you will be able to check it back into a library.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">Acquire Check Out is valuable in certain circumstances, such as when you are using Adept for the first time and you have documents you've been working on locally that are more recent than the versions in the Adept Vault.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
