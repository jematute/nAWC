<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">A document in your work area has a status of Duplicate when Adept detects there is another document with the same name in a library. Some reasons you might have a document in your work area with a status of Duplicate:</span></p>

<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">Typically Adept won't permit you to check in a Duplicate document. However, in some situations you may want to check one in. For example if you edited a Duplicate document, thinking it was checked out, and you don't want to lose your changes, you would want to check it in. To return a Duplicate document back to a library containing a document with the same name, use the Acquire Check Out command.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">When you select a document in the work area with a status of Duplicate and select the command Acquire Check Out, located on the Document tab, Adept converts the status of the document you selected from Duplicate to Out. Now that the document is Out it behaves like any other Out document and can be checked in. (If the status doesn't change to Out, press the F5 key to refresh your window.)</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">If the exact document name is used in more than one library, you are presented with a list of libraries where this document name is duplicated. Select the library where this document will be returned when you check it in. You must use caution because Adept has no way to know which library is the right one, so you should be clear about selecting the right library.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">In any given operation, Acquire Check Out can only operate on documents from one library at a time. When you select more than one document and then select Acquire Check Out, Adept checks to see if all the selected documents are all from the same library. If there are some from one library and some from another, you are prompted to select which ones you want to include in your Acquire Check Out command.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-style: italic;">Note: If you checked out a document that was on HOLD and then <a href="awc_release_checkout.htm" class="topiclink">Release Check Out</a>, the document in your work area is Duplicate. If you then Acquire Check Out, the copy in your work area changes from Duplicate to Out. When you check this document in, it will overwrite the copy in the Holding Area.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">Acquire Check Out is especially valuable immediately after a new installation of Adept. During installation, the documents stored in your network directories are Synchronized into Adept libraries. During the period while the documents are being synchronized, you may be continuing your work, editing copies of these documents on your local drive. When you start using Adept, the documents on your hard drive have a status of Duplicate because Adept detects they have the same name as a document already in a library. To check these in for the first time, you would first use the Acquire Check Out command to convert their status to Out. After the documents' status is Out, you can now check them in normally.</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext" style="font-weight: bold;">Batch Acquire Check Out</span></p>
<p class="p_bodytext"><span class="f_bodytext">Adept also allows you to select multiple documents before issuing an Acquire Check Out. However, this Batch Acquire Check Out is limited to returning documents to a single library. When you issue this command, you will select the library where you want your documents to go. If Adept finds a document of the same name in that library, it will proceed. If not, it will issue an error message.</span></p>
